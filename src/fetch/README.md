# Fetch MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that provides web content fetching capabilities. This server enables LLMs to retrieve and process content from web pages, converting HTML to markdown for easier consumption.

Presently the server only supports fetching HTML content.

### Available Tools

- `fetch` - Fetches a URL from the internet and extracts its contents as markdown.

### Prompts

- **fetch**
  - Fetch a URL and extract its contents as markdown
  - Argument: `url` (string, required): URL to fetch

## Installation

### Using uv (recommended)

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *mcp-server-fetch*.

### Using PIP

Alternatively you can install `mcp-server-fetch` via pip:

```
pip install mcp-server-fetch
```

After installation, you can run it as a script using:

```
python -m mcp_server_fetch
```

## Configuration

### Configure for Claude.app

Add to your Claude settings:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "fetch": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "fetch": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_fetch"]
  }
}
```
</details>

### Configure for Zed

Add to your Zed settings.json:

<details>
<summary>Using uvx</summary>

```json
"context_servers": [
  "mcp-server-fetch": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
  }
],
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Using pip installation</summary>

```json
"context_servers": {
  "mcp-server-fetch": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "mcp_server_fetch"]
  }
},
```
</details>

### Customization - robots.txt

By default, the server will obey a websites robots.txt file if the request came from the model (via a tool), but not if
the request was user initiated (via a prompt). This can be disabled by adding the argument `--ignore-robots-txt` to the
`args` list in the configuration.

### Customization - User-agent

By default, depending on if the request came from the model (via a tool), or was user initiated (via a prompt), the 
server will use either the user-agent
```
ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (Autonomous; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
```
or
```
ModelContextProtocol/1.0 (User-Specified; +https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
```

This can be customized by adding the argument `--user-agent=YourUserAgent` to the `args` list in the configuration.

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-fetch
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/fetch
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-fetch
```
